- 👋 Hi, I’m @SteffNdei
- 👀 I’m interested in finding great team members for a Language Technology project focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), building a team that aims to contribute to linguistic diversity in technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced NLP techniques, particularly those involving machine learning models that can efficiently process under-represented languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to develop open-source tools for NLP, especially those that can be adapted for educational and communicative use in East Africa.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me a message right here on GitHub or email me at st3ffgame@gmail.com for more details about our project and how you might contribute.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Besides my tech passion, I'm an avid football fan and enjoy philosophizing
